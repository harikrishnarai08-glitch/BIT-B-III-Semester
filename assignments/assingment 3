 Short Questions 
 
1. Define Information Architecture (IA).
Information Architecture (IA) is the process of organizing, structuring, and labeling website content so that users can easily find and understand information.

2. What is a ”Wireframe”?
A wireframe is a simple visual blueprint of a website that shows the layout and placement of elements (like menus, buttons, content) without detailed design or colors.

3. Explain the concept of ”Cognitive Friction” in web design.
Cognitive friction refers to the mental effort required by users when a website is confusing, poorly organized, or difficult to navigate, which reduces usability and user satisfaction.

4. Why should URL slugs use hyphens instead of underscores?
Hyphens are preferred because search engines treat hyphens as word separators, improving readability and SEO, whereas underscores are not recognized as separators.

5. Compare and contrast Hierarchical (Tree) structure and Linear (Sequential) structure.
Give an example of when to use each.
Aspect            	Hierarchical Structure	          Linear Structure
Organization	      Parent-child structure	          Step-by-step order
Navigation        	Multiple paths	                  Single path
Usage              	Large websites                   	Tutorials, forms

Example:
Hierarchical: University website (Home → Departments → Courses)
Linear: Online exam or checkout process

6. Explain the ”Three-Click Rule” and its significance in User Experience (UX) design.
The Three-Click Rule states that users should find any information within three clicks.
Its significance lies in improving user satisfaction, reducing frustration, and increasing engagement by making navigation simple and efficient.


7. ”Plan before you do.” Explain how tools like Card Sorting and Flowcharts help in planning
a website’s structure

Card Sorting: Helps organize content based on how users think, improving navigation and IA.
Flowcharts: Visually represent user paths and interactions, helping designers plan logical and efficient workflows.

Together, they reduce errors and ensure a user-centered website structure.
