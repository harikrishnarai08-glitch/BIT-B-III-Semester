   7. ”The Internet is a network of networks.” Elaborate on this statement explaining how packet switching works.
      The Internet is called a network of networks because it connects millions of smaller networks (home networks, school networks, office networks, ISP networks) into one global system.

How packet switching works:
When data is sent over the Internet, it is broken into small packets.
Each packet contains:
    Part of the data
    Source address
    Destination address
Packets travel through different routes across multiple networks.
Routers decide the best available path for each packet.
At the destination, packets are reassembled in the correct order.

Why packet switching is important:
Efficient use of network resources
Faster and reliable communication
If one path fails, packets take another route

Simple example:
Sending a message is like sending a book page by page through different roads; all pages are collected and arranged at the end
