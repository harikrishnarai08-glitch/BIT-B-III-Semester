Short Questions 

1. Define the term ”Sitemap” in the planning phase.
Sitemap is a structured diagram or list that shows all the pages of a website and how they are connected to each other.
  It helps developers and designers:
  Plan the website structure
  Organize content clearly

in simple with example 
A sitemap is a visual or textual representation of a website’s pages and their hierarchical relationship, created during the planning phase to organize content and navigation.

Decide navigation paths before development starts

2. What is the purpose of the ”Launch” phase in web development?
The Launch phase is the final stage of the web development process, where the website is made live and accessible to users. Its main purpose is to ensure that the website is fully functional, stable, and ready for public use.

Key purposes of the Launch phase:
Deploying the Website
   The website is uploaded to the live server or hosting environment.
   Domain name is connected so users can access it online.

Final Testing
   Check for bugs, broken links, loading issues, and errors.
   Ensure the website works properly on different browsers and devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).
Performance & Security Check
   Verify page speed, server response, and basic security settings.
   Ensure forms, databases, and user interactions work correctly.
Content Verification
   Confirm that all text, images, videos, and links are correct and complete.
   Remove placeholder or test content.
User Accessibilit
   Make the website available to the target audience.
   Ensure usability and smooth navigation.

3. Why is ”Documentation” important in the development lifecycle?
Documentation is important in the development lifecycle because it provides a clear record of the system’s design, functionality, and usage. It helps developers, testers, and users understand how the system works and how it should be maintained.

Importance of Documentation:
  1:Improves understanding – It explains system requirements, design, and workflow, making the project easier to understand for new and existing team members.
  2:Aids maintenance and updates – Proper documentation helps developers fix bugs, add features, and update the system efficiently.
  3:Ensures consistency – It acts as a reference to ensure the system is developed according to requirements.
  4:Supports communication – It improves communication between developers, managers, and clients.
  5:Helps users – User manuals and guides help users operate the system correctly.
  6:Saves time and cost – Reduces confusion and rework during development and future enhancements.

4. Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development
Front-end Development
Deals with user interface
What users see and interact with	
Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript	
Focuses on design and usability	
Runs in the browser	

Back-end Development
Deals with server-side logic
Works behind the scenes
Uses PHP, Python, Java, Node.js
Focuses on databases and security
Runs on the server

Long Question 
5. ”Planning is the most critical phase of web development.” Discuss this statement by listing
the key activities performed during the planning phase.
Planning is considered the most critical phase of web development because it lays the foundation for the entire project. A well-planned website reduces errors, saves time and cost, and ensures that the final product meets user and business requirements. If planning is weak, problems appear in later stages like design, development, and maintenance.

The key activities performed during the planning phase are:
 1. Requirement Analysis
   This involves understanding the purpose of the website and the needs of users and clients.
   It answers questions like:
   What is the website for?
   Who are the target users?
   What features are required?

 2. Defining Goals and Objectives
   Clear goals are set, such as:  
   Increasing online presence
   Selling products
   Providing information or services
   This helps guide design and development decisions.

 3. Target Audience Identification
   Understanding the audience’s age, device usage, language, and preferences helps in designing a user-friendly website.

 4. Content Planning
   Deciding what content will be included:
   Text
   Images
   Videos
   Forms
   This ensures relevant and organized information.

 5. Sitemap Creation
   A sitemap defines the structure of the website, showing how pages are connected.
   It helps in easy navigation and better user experience.

 6. Technology Selection
   Choosing appropriate technologies such as:
   Front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
   Back-end (PHP, Python, Node.js)
   Database (MySQL, MongoDB)

 7. Budget and Time Estimation
   Planning includes estimating
   Project cost
   Development timeline
   This helps in managing resources efficiently.

 8. Risk Identification
   Possible risks such as technical issues, budget overruns, or security concerns are identified in advance.




6. Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly
”finished”?
The Maintenance phase of web development is iterative, meaning it is a continuous and repeating process, not a one-time activity. After a website is launched, it requires regular updates, improvements, and fixes based on user feedback, technology changes, and business needs.
In this phase, developers repeatedly:
  Monitor website performance
  Fix bugs and errors
  Update content
  Improve features
  Enhance security
  Optimize speed and compatibility

Why a Website Is Never Truly “Finished”

A website is never truly finished because:
 Changing User Requirements
   User needs and expectations evolve over time. New features may be required to improve user experience.
 Technological Advancements
   New browsers, devices, frameworks, and standards keep emerging, requiring updates for compatibility.

 Security Updates
  New security threats appear regularly, so websites must be updated to stay secure.

 Content Updates
   Information, products, blogs, or services on a website must be updated frequently to stay relevant.

 Performance Improvements
   Websites need ongoing optimization to load faster and work better on new devices.

 Feedback and Analytics
   User feedback and data analysis often lead to redesigns or feature enhancements.


7. Describe the process of ”Information Gathering.” Why is understanding the target audi
ence crucial during this step?
Information Gathering
Information Gathering is the first and most important step in the web development process. In this phase, developers and stakeholders collect all necessary information about the website before any design or coding begins.

This process includes:
Understanding the purpose of the website (educational, business, e-commerce, portfolio, etc.)
Identifying the goals and objectives of the website
Collecting content requirements (text, images, videos, features)
Determining functional requirements (login system, forms, payment gateway, search, etc.)
Studying competitors and existing similar websites
Identifying technical requirements like hosting, domain, security, and technologies to be used

Importance of Understanding the Target Audience
 Understanding the target audience is crucial because the website is ultimately built for users, not developers.
 Knowing the target audience helps in:
 Designing a user-friendly interface suitable for their age, skills, and preferences
 Choosing the right language, tone, and content style
 Deciding appropriate colors, layout, and navigation
 Ensuring better usability and user experience 
 Increasing engagement and achieving website goals (sales, learning, interaction, etc.)

 Scenario-Based Questions 


8. You are the project manager for a new e-commerce site. The client wants to skip the
”Testing” phase to save money and launch early. Write a persuasive argument explaining
the potential risks (security, functionality, compatibility) of skipping this phase.

Skipping the Testing phase to save money and launch early is risky and can cause serious long-term problems.

Potential Risks
1. Security Risks
Website may be vulnerable to hacking and data breaches
Customer payment and personal data may be exposed
Can damage company reputation and trust

2. Functionality Issues
Broken links, forms not submitting, payment failures
Poor user experience leading to lost customers
Bugs may crash the website during peak usage

3. Compatibility Problems
Website may not work properly on:
Mobile phones
Different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
Different screen sizes
Results in loss of users

9. Adeveloper begins coding a website immediately after meeting the client, without creating
a design prototype or sitemap. Midway through, the client rejects the layout. Analyze
what went wrong in the process and how it should have been handled.

What Went Wrong
Developer started coding immediately without:  
  Design prototype
  Sitemap
  Client approval
No clear planning or documentation
Client expectations were not properly understood

This led to wasted time, effort, and cost when the client rejected the layout.
How It Should Have Been Handled
 Follow proper development process:
  Information Gatherin
  Planning (Sitemap & wireframe)
  Design prototype
  Client approval
  Development

Regular feedback from the client before coding
Proper planning avoids misunderstandings and rework.

10. A university website was launched successfully, but after six months, students stopped
visiting it because the exam schedules were outdated. Which phase of the development
lifecycle was neglected? Explain the activities involved in this phase

Neglected Phase: Maintenance Phase
The university website became outdated because the Maintenance phase was ignored.
 Activities in the Maintenance Phase
 Regular content updates (exam schedules, notices)
 Fixing bugs and broken links
 Improving performance and security
 Updating design and features as needed
 Monitoring user feedback

A website must be continuously updated to remain useful. Without maintenance, even a well-designed website becomes irrelevant and unused.
